| Product Owner        | Development Team      | Scrum Master      | 
| ------------- |-------------|-------------| 
| The Product Owner is accountable for the success of the product, maximizing the ROI. | The Development Team is accountable for delivering potentially releasable increment of DONE product at the end of every Sprint. | A Scrum Master is accountable for building high performing team(s), facilitating their consensus and removing impediments. |

### 3. What are Scrum Artifacts?

There are 3 Scrum Artifacts to raise transparency, which are as follows:
* Product Backlog
* Sprint Backlog
* Increment

| Product Backlog        | Sprint Backlog      | Increment      | 
| ------------- |-------------|-------------| 
| To formulate the Product Vision and desire of the stake holders. Raise transparency by presenting the perceived value and roadmap for the product.             | Direction and Focus for the scrum team for achieving the Sprint Goal. Raise transparency within the Scrum Team. | A working product to release to the Production that formulate the Sprint Goal. Raise transparency within the Scrum Team and Stakeholders. |
| An enventory of things to be done on Product. An ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product. Single source of repository for the Development Team to pull the work from. | Forecast of the work that the Development Team undertook and the plan to deliver the same to achieve the Scrum Goal. | Sum of all Product Backlogs Items that were forecasted to achieve the Sprint Goal built on top of increment from the previous Sprint. |

### 4. What are Scrum Events?

There are 5 Scrum Events which are as follows:
* Sprint

Let's understand these events in brief:
| Event        | Inspect      | Adapt      | Participants | Timebox |
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------| 
| **Sprint** | Product | Increment | Scrum Team | 30 days or less |
| **Sprint Planning** | Product Backlog for requirements, Available Capacity or Velocity, Definition of Done and Retrospective Improvements | Sprint Goal, Forecast (the Product Backlog Iteams / requirements) and plan to deliver the Forecasted Product Backlog Items and Sprint Goal = Sprint Backlog | Scrum Team (Scrum Master + Product Owner + Development Team) | 8 hours for 30 days and usually short for shorter duration |
  | **Daily Scrum** | Progress towards the Sprint (Goal, Forecast, Sprint Backlog) | Day plan i.e. updated Sprint Backlog | Development Team (Scrum Master and Product Owner's participation is decided by the Development Team) | 15 minutes |
| **Sprint Review** | Increment created by Development Team, Product Backlog, Current business conditions | Feedback that goes to the Product Backlog | Scrum Team (Scrum Master + Product Owner + Development Team) and Stakeholders | 4 hours for 30 days and usually short for shorter duration |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | Process and Practices, People and Reationships, Definition of Done | Actionable and Commited improvement items for the next Sprint (at least one) | Scrum Team (Scrum Master + Product Owner + Development Team) | 3 hours for 30 days and usually short for shorter duration |

### 10. Scrum Terminologies?

Following are the key Scrum Terminologies:

* **Empiricism :** Process control type in which only the past is accepted as certain and in which decisions are based on observation, experience and experimentation. Empiricism has three pillars: Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation.
* **Scrum Board :** A physical board to visualize information for and by the Scrum Team, often used to manage Sprint Backlog. Scrum Boards are an optional implementation within the Scrum to make information visible.
